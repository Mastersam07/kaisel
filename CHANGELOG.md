## 0.2.0 — Guards, equality, and shells

Three additions, one breaking change.

### Added

- **`GateGuard<R>` pipeline.** Pass `guards: [...]` to `GateRouter` / `ShellRouter` /
  `GateShell`. Each guard is `FutureOr<List<R>> Function(current, proposed)`;
  guards run in order, each receiving the previous's output. Return the
  proposed stack unchanged to allow, a different stack to redirect, or
  `current` to refuse. Sync or async — async guards make the navigation
  async, sync guards complete synchronously. Guards do not run on
  navigator-driven pops (system back); they run on `push`/`pop`/`replace`/
  `set`/`popUntil` and on incoming deep links via `setNewRoutePath`.
- **Default `props`-based equality on `GateRoute`.** Override `props` with
  the fields you want compared; `==`/`hashCode` come for free. No-field
  variants don't need anything — `Home() == Home()` works out of the box.
  Eliminates the manual equality boilerplate from v0.1 examples.
- **`ShellRouter<R>` and `GateShell<R>`.** Multi-branch navigation with
  per-tab back stacks, independent routers, optional branch-scoped
  state (`branchScope: (context, i, child) => MyProvider(...)`), and
  Android back-button handling via `PopScope`: in-branch back unwinds
  the branch stack; at branch root, back falls through to the parent
  router (which may pop the shell itself). `ShellScope` exposes both the
  shell router and the active branch's router via inherited widget;
  `context.branchRouter<R>()` and `context.shellRouter<R>()` are the
  convenience accessors.
- **Identity-preserving stack diff.** When you push a route, existing
  pages keep their navigator state. Previously, every mutation
  rebuilt every entry — fine for v0.1 but wasteful. Now the diff
  preserves entries whose route at the same position is equal.

### Breaking

- **Router mutations now return `Future`**: `push`, `pop`, `replace`,
  `set`, and `popUntil` return `Future<void>` (or `Future<bool>` for
  `pop`). Migration: if you don't have async guards, fire-and-forget
  works — `router.push(x)` without an `await` is fine; the Future
  completes synchronously. If you check the return of `pop`, await it.

### Fixed

- Rapid concurrent pops without `await` now unwind the stack one
  level per call, instead of silently coalescing into a single pop.
  Each operation's target is computed at task-run time, not at
  call-site time.

### Deliberately not shipped (v0.3+)

- Modal sub-flows with typed result returns (`await router.run<T>(...)`).
- Composable `RouteModule`s mountable at URL prefixes.
- Multi-route URL encoding (deep stacks like `/a/b/c` decoding to multiple frames).
- Adaptive layout policies on routes (master-detail responsive).
- Direction-aware and shared-element transitions.
- Per-branch typed route subtypes inside a shell.

## 0.1.0 — Foundation

Initial release.

- `GateRoute` base marker for sealed route types.
- `GateRouter<R>` state container with `push`, `pop`, `replace`, `set`, `popUntil`.
- `GateRouterDelegate<R>` plugging into `MaterialApp.router`.
- `GateRouteInformationParser<R>` for URL → route stack restoration.
- `GateCodec<R>` interface for URL ↔ route mapping.
- Identity-stable internal page keying so duplicate equal routes on the stack coexist.
- Pure-Dart unit tests for the navigation state.
